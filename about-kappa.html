     Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. was founded in 1911 at Indiana University by a group of ten visionary young Black men committed to creating a brotherhood grounded in achievement, leadership, and mutual support. These founders faced a campus environment marked by isolation and exclusion. Black students were often ignored by their peers, denied access to recreational and social facilities, and restricted in participation in athletics and other activities. Many could go weeks without seeing another student of similar background, making community and camaraderie nearly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Earlier Greek-letter organizations, including Alpha Kappa Nu, had briefly emerged on the Indiana campus, reflecting the desire of Black students to establish a voice and sense of belonging. Though these early efforts could not endure, they highlighted the potential value of a fraternity and inspired future leaders. Against this backdrop, the founders of Kappa Alpha Psi first organized as Alpha Omega, a temporary group that allowed them to come together, share ideas, and build the foundation for a permanent fraternity. Their goal was to create an organization that emphasized achievement, character, and support for one another, regardless of wealth, social standing, or privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
     The founders' determination led to the incorporation of Kappa Alpha Nu, the original name of the fraternity, on May 15, 1911. This step marked a historic achievement: one of the first national Greek-letter organizations founded by Black undergraduates. Motivated by Christian ideals and the purpose of achievement, the founders sought to inspire young men to reach their highest potential and to provide a lifelong community of brothers who would support, encourage, and challenge one another.

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Their [Diggs' and Armstrong's] presence along with eight other
      black men was almost completely ignored by white students. To make
      matters worse, one black might be on campus for weeks without seeing
      another. Under these circumstances, assimilation into the life of the school
      was impossible. The administration maintained an attitude of indifference
      as blacks were slowly matriculated and swiftly forgotten. They were denied
      use of entertainment and recreational facilities, and only in field and track
      were they permitted to display their athletic prowess. Participation in
      contact sports was emphatically denied them. Something had to be done
      to alleviate this condition, and something was done (The Story of Kappa Alpha Psi).

       Integral to the founding of this Noble Clan were the Founders: Elder Watson Diggs, Byron Kenneth Armstrong,
       Ezra D. Alexander, Henry Tourner Asher, Marcus Peter Blakemore, Paul Waymond Caine, George Wesley Edmonds, Guy
       Levis Grant, Edward Giles Irvin, and John Milton Lee. It was these ten gentlemen who possessed the imagination, ambition, courage and determination to defy custom in pursuit of a college education and careers.
      </p>

      <p>
       The name Kappa Alpha Nu did not stay long with the fraternity and was amended. The incident that led to this decision occurred when Frank Summers, a member of the fraternity, was participating in a track meet. Founder Elder Watson Diggs overheard a white student referring to Summers as a member of "Kappa Alpha N-----." Additionally, the abbreviation "KAN" was often confused with the state of Kansas, leading to further misunderstandings. These racial jeers and derogatory references highlighted the need for a change. Consequently, the fraternity's name was changed to Kappa Alpha Psi, adopting the Greek letter "Ψ" in place of "N" to establish a distinctive Greek-letter identity. This change was officially adopted at the Grand Chapter Meeting in December 1914 and became effective on April 15, 1915.

      <p>
       Over the following century, Kappa Alpha Psi has grown into a national organization with enduring influence, remaining true to the vision of its founders. It has consistently promoted leadership, scholarship, service, and the celebration of achievement. The fraternity’s legacy is a testament to resilience, foresight, and the enduring power of brotherhood—a community built to uplift, inspire, and leave a lasting impact on both its members and society at large.
