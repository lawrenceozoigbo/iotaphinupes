        <p> Chartered in 1979 at Cornell University, the Iota Phi Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. has proudly carried forward the ideals and traditions of our Noble Clan for nearly half a century. Since our founding, the brothers of Iota Phi have cultivated a strong and enduring bond rooted in achievement, service, and lifelong friendship. Our chapter has served as a home for men committed to excelling academically, leading with integrity, and contributing meaningfully to both the Cornell community and the broader world. </p>

        <p> This site seeks to honor and celebrate that legacy by highlighting the many ways in which our brothers — past and present — continue to embody the fraternity's guiding principle of “Achievement in Every Field of Human Endeavor.” It is designed not only to spotlight the efforts and accomplishments of our undergraduate brothers as they uphold our presence on the yard, but also to showcase the wide-ranging successes of our distinguished alumni, whose impact extends far beyond the Hill. </p>

        <p> Here, you will find stories of mentorship, service initiatives, academic excellence, professional accomplishments, and the bonds of brotherhood that have shaped generations of Iota Phi men. By documenting these contributions, we hope to preserve our rich history, inspire future brothers, and affirm the enduring relevance of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. at Cornell University and beyond.</p>
